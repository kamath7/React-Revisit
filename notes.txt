Why use React and not just JS?

Repeating Code in just JS 
React- Splitting application into smaller and smaller bits to make the code manageable. React does the job of combining them all 

Single page app - Server only sends one HTML page. Thereafter react takes over and controls UI

Why components in React?
a) Reusability - Dont repeat yourself
b) Separation of Concerns - Dont do too many things in pne and the same place
