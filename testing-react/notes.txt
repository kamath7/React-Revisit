Manual testing - Error prone. hard to test all possible combinations and scenarios 
Automated Testing - COde that tests your code. Test individual building blocks of app. Very technical but allows to test all building blocks at once 

Different kinds of Automated tests 

Unit test - Test individual building blocks in isolation. Typically 10s to 100s are written
Integration tests  - Tests combination of multiple building blocks. Typically couple of tests 
End to End tests - Tests which include complete scenarios for hte app as a real user . only a handful of these are written 

What to test 
 - test different building blocks 
 - unit tests - smallest building blocks that make up app 

 How to test 
 - test success and failure cases. also some rare scenarios


 Required tools 
 - Tool to run tests and asserting results and also tool for simulating components 
 - jest to test and react testing library to simulate
