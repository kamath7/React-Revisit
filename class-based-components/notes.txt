No hooks in CBC

three methods

componentDidMount() -> Called once, component mounted (was evaluated and rendered) - Similar to useEffect
componentDidUpdate() -> Called once component updated - Similar to useEffect with dependency
componentWillUnmount() -> called before component removed from DOM -> useEffect's cleanup function


CBC vs FB
