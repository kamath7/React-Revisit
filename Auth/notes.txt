authentication - 
Needed if content needs to be protected

Auth is a 2 step process 

-> Get access 
->Send req to protected resource  

Problems - Fake auth creds to server to request protected data

Can use either 
- Server side sessions 
- Auth tokens 

Servver Side Sessions 
- Store unique identifier on server, sendsame identifier to client
- Client sends identifier along with requests to protected resources .
Flaw in SSS - Everything tightly coupled. 

Auth Tokens - 
- Create (but not store) "permission" token on server, send token to client 
- Client sends token along with requests to protected resources
